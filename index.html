    <p class="highlight" center-this>I am from Korea.</strong> When I eas in university in Korea. My major was management. While attending school, I constantly thought about what to do in the future and became interest into practice and applied to George Brown college.</a></p>

    <p class="highlight" center-this> I came to Canada to put that interest into practice. I think my major in Korea is easy to integrate with interaction. And I am interested in UX,UI design. I like communication with other people for working. However, I don’t have any background of design. So,I want to learn design a lot.<a href="https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/interaction-design-program-g113"> interaction design detailed.</a></p>
